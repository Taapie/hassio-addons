## Description

This addon provide a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) Proxy with multiple vhost support and automatic ssl (obtention and renewal). It should be a easier option than the nginx_proxy and certbot addons.

The simplier way to use it is just to set your external address in the homeassistant field.
